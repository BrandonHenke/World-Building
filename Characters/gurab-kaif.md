## Personality
Zag is somewhat rezerved and quiet.
He often appears calm, even in difficult situations.

He's anxious.
He distracts himself by fiddling with things in his hands.
This fiddling either caused or was assisted by an affinity for manipulating the sorceric field.

He is vengeful, as a result.
