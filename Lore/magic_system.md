# Magic System

## The Invariants

All magic in the universe is due to the Mystical.
The sorceric field interacts with the other four fields to produce different effects.

## Fundamentals

* Magic or the sorceric field is the fifth force/fundamental field of nature.
* Bosons have an interaction term with this field, but fermions don't.
  * Thus, the fields are directly affected by the sorceric field, while familiar, everyday matter isn't.
* Different frequencies of waves in the sorceric field will cause different reactions:
  * More energetic waves are required to manipulate (overcome) the natural tendencies of the four forces.
    * Like how more energy is required to pull a ball out of a deep well than is required to pick the ball up from the ground.
  * Stronger fundamental forces means more energy is required to get a small change.
  * Similarly, if the fundamental force is relatively weak, more energy is required to get a meaningful effect:
    * Gravity is very weak, so creating a gravitational well, may required a lot of effort, but small changes aren't as difficult to pull off as changes in the electromagnetic field.

## Magic Details

The Sorceric field is a four dimensional vector valued field.
Consider the Sorceric vector:
$$
	m = m^\mu v_\mu,
$$
where $v_\mu$ is the unit vector for each of the four other fundamental fields of the universe, with each index assigned as follows:
$$\begin{align*}
	v_0 &\rightarrow \text{Gravitational field},\\
	v_1 &\rightarrow \text{Nuclear Weak field},\\
	v_2 &\rightarrow \text{Electromagnetic field},\\
	v_3 &\rightarrow \text{Nuclear Strong field}.
\end{align*}$$
If an individual produces the Sorceric vector $m = m^0v_0$, then this will only have an effect on the gravitational field.
Any magical effect can be represented as a four dimensional vector in the vector space spanned by the basis vectors $v_\mu$.

The metric tensor for this vector space is a bit interesting:
$$
	g_{\mu\nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
		1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
		0 & 10^{35} & 0 & 0\\
		0 & 0 & 10^{37} & 0\\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 10^{39}\\
	\end{pmatrix},
$$
normalized to the Gravitational force.
The total amount of magic required for an effect given by $m$ is the square of the vector,
$$\begin{align*}
	m^2 &= (m^\mu)^2 v_\mu^2,\\
	&= (m^0)^2 + (m^1)^2 10^{35} + (m^2)^2 10^{37} + (m^3)^2 10^{39}.
\end{align*}$$

The nature of this magic system allows for countering effects.
An effect can, in fact, be completely negated.
If the Sorceric field takes on a value of $m_1$ at some location and time, $(\tau, x)$, then this effect can be cancelled if a new value of $m_2 = -m_1$ is applied at the same location and time.
This is *extremely* difficult to do, since one must be able to know the value of the Sorceric field in the location in question.

There are other options of countering the effects that one can employ more easily, however, but those still required a great deal of tact and understanding to employ.
