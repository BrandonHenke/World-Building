# **Magic System**

## **The Invariants**

All magic in the universe is due to the Mystical.
The Invariants can be thought of as fields that permiate all space.
In this interpretation, the Mystical becomes a field with a non-zero value everywhere.
Similarly, the other Invariants can be associated with fields

## **People of the Planet**

The general population doesn't know much, if anything about magic, or even that it exists.

- Belief based?
  - The more people believe in something, the "truer" it is.
  - What's the source?
  - What's the cost?
- Invariant magic?
  - Magic that is invariant when it comes to beliefs (it's there whether people believe it or not).

Magic is a secret.

### *Invariant Magic*

The ones that know about it are devoted to the Invariants (the Arbiters(?)).
Those devoted to the Invariants know how to use the five schools of magic:

1. Spatempóriamancy - Spacetime manipulation
2. Matériamancy - Matter manipulation
3. Lúcimancy - Light manipulation
4. Fortunímancy - Probability manipulation

The schools are numbered from most "problematic" to least "problematic".
The more "problematic" the higher the cost (costs to be determined).

The schools work by transferring energy from the Mystical field to the other fields, using something as a conduate.
The conduate is subject to energy disipation, similar to how wires have a resistance, so, when carrying current, energy is dissipated into them in the form of heat.

The human body is a poor conductor.
Channeling energy from the Mystical through one's own body can cause damage to the individual.
However, the individual can channel a small amount of energy into a focus (the focus acting as a sort of transistor allowing energy to transfer through the focus).
All materials have different "resistances", so some foci work better than others, in that they won't be damaged as much by the channeled energy.

### *Faith Magic*

The beliefs of individuals essentially channel extremely small amounts of energy from the Mystical.
This energy is channeled into all five schools, with relative amounts depending how "problematic" the school is.
For example, each individual will innately channel an amount of energy $m^2 = m^i m_i$, where
$$
m = m^i e_i, \tag{1}
$$
where $e_i$ is the magic school (corresponding to the numbered list above), $(m^i)^2$ is the amount of energy channeled in the form of that school.

In fact, this (equation 1) is the basis of all magic.
Using different components ($m^i$) in the different schools produce different intended (and unintended) effects.
