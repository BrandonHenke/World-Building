# Djinn and Daeva

There are two levels of god-like beings: Daeva and Djinn.

## Djinn

Djinn are beings that are born from religions.
Djinn are products of the people.
People blindly create Djinn out of their beliefs.
The Djinn, therefore, know nothing more than the people that created them.
They understand that they have abilities given to them by the people, but know nothing more.

## Daeva

Daeva are born human and become god-like through their understanding of magic.
Daeva are more powerful than Djinn, due to their study of magic and how the universe works.
One of the reasons Daeva are incredibly powerful is that they have mastered the ability to completely negate an effect from the Sorceric field, described in the magic details section of [Magic System](magic_system.md#magic-details).
