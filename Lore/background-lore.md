# **Background**

## **The Invariants**
> The Twisted (spacetime)  
> The Inviting (electroweak + strong unification)  
> The Fortunate (quantum mechanics)  
> The Mystical (magical)  

The universe was created.
The Invariants were created out of Order during the shattering.

These are personifications of physics concepts (gravity, the electroweak and strong force, the fundamental effects of quantum mechanics, and magic).

### **Interactions**
> T+I = the weird  
> T+F = the cosmos  
> T+M = spacetime warping (tempórimancy+spátimancy)  
> I+F = Chaos (StatM + ClassM)  
> I+M = light (lúcimancy) + matter manipulation (matérimancy)  
> F+M = magical probability manipulation (fortúnimancy)  

## **Invariant Constructs**

### *The Twisted and the Mystical*

The Warper and the Mystic created the different planes of existance, outside of the physical one.
Examples include:
> The "Hub World"  
> All afterlives (one world just different locations?)

## **Vallonia**

The people of Vallonia (Vallonians) are comprised of only a race of humans.
