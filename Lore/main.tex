\section{The Start}

At the beginning, there was Order.
The Order was shattered, giving rise to the four Invariants:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Twisted
	\item The Inviting
	\item The Fortunate
	\item The Mystical
\end{itemize}

\section{Magic}

All magic in the universe is due to the Mystical.
The Invariants can be thought of as fields that permiate all space.
In this interpretation, the Mystical becomes a field with a non-zero value everywhere.
Similarly, the other Invariants can be associated with fields.

\subsection{Invariant Magic Mechanics}

There are five schools of magic:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Tempórimancy - Time manipulation
	\item Spátiamancy - Space manipulation
	\item Matériamancy - Matter manipulation
	\item Lúcimancy - Light manipulation
	\item Fortunímancy - Probability manipulation
\end{enumerate}

The schools are numbered from most "problematic" to least "problematic".
The more "problematic" the higher the cost, so require more magic current to be channeled.

I introduce the magía vector, $m$,
\begin{equation}
	m = m^i e_i
	\label{eq : magic vector}
\end{equation}
where $e_i$ is the magic school (corresponding to the numbered list above), $(m^i)^2$ is the amount of energy channeled into the $i^{\text{th}}$ school of magic.
The individual is able to control each component to channel different amounts of energy into each school, but this energy must be channeled through a conduate.

The conduate is subject to energy disipation, similar to how wires have a resistance, so, when carrying current, energy is dissipated into them in the form of heat.
Most things can be used as a conduate, however, different materials are better conductors than others, and can withstand more magic current.
The human body can be used as a conductor, but it is not a very good one, and a tollerance must be built up to channel large amounts of energy through it.
Think microfractures in bones: microfractures heal back stronger, complete breaks do not.

Channeling energy from the Mystical through one's own body can cause damage to the individual.
Instead, the individual can channel a small amount of energy into a focus, allowing the wielder to control the magic current and channel it through the focus instead.
All materials have different "resistances", so some foci work better than others, in that they won't be damaged as much by the channeled energy.

\subsubsection{Faith Manifestation}

The general population knows nothing about magic.
However, every individual has the ability to use magic, and will passively channel magic without knowing it.
When enough individuals believe the same thing and channel magic energy into that belief, the combined result is the manifestation of the beliefs held by the group.

The energy disipation in an individual can cause a warm feeling, which is often mistaken for the presence of their deity or something along those lines.
Additionally, individuals may unconsciously channel energy through a focus.
These foci tend to be the icons of the individual's religion.
