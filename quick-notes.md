* Magic or the sorceric field is the fifth force/fundamental field of nature.
* Bosons have an interaction term with this field, but fermions don't.
  * Thus, the fields are directly affected by the sorceric field, while familiar, everyday matter isn't.
* Different frequencies of waves in the sorceric field will cause different reactions:
  * More energetic waves are required to manipulate (overcome) the natural tendencies of the four forces.
    * Like how more energy is required to pull a ball out of a deep well than is required to pick the ball up from the ground.
  * Stronger fundamental forces means more energy is required to get a small change.
  * Similarly, if the fundamental force is relatively weak, more energy is required to get a meaningful effect:
    * Gravity is very weak, so creating a gravitational well, may required a lot of effort, but small changes aren't as difficult to pull off as changes in the electromagnetic field.
